## Handshake
### What is Handshake?
Handshake is a decentralized internet naming protocol that enables users to outright _own_ a Top Level Domain that can be used for websites, email addresses or crypto address.


### What is Handshake's Ticker?
HNS

### How is the Handshake Token used?
The native HNS token is used to register TLDs which are pinned to a specific certificate as the identity on the Handshake blockchain. (Aka, we use the token HNS to purchase TLD names)

## Top Level Domains
### What is a Top Level Domain (TLD)
A top level domain (TLD) refers to the last segment of a domain name or part that follows immediately after the “dot” symbol. A TLD is at the highest level in the hierarchical Domain Naming System (DNS). Here are some popular TLD’s you are most likely familiar with:
- .com
- .org
- .edu
- .gov
- .biz

### How does purchasing and the auction process work?
The Handshake auction process uses a strategy called the Vickrey Auction. The Vickrey Auction works by, a participant is only aware of their own bid. The bids are revealed at the end of the auction when a winner is chosen. The winner pays the second highest bid instead of their own. Typically, Handshake auctions last two weeks before a winner is selected.

### What if the TLD I’m looking for isn’t available for auction yet?
If the TLD you are searching for is unavailable, some registrars give you the option to set notifications for new domains being released to auction. This way you will always stay on top of your TLD of interest and be the first to know when it’s available for auction.

### What can I do with my domain?
Your Handshake domain is not your typical domain name you purchase from GoDaddy or Namecheap. Your Handshake name can be used for your website, email address or any crypto address, secured with photo identity confirmation. Your Handshake domain is 100% unique and cannot not be duplicated so you always know exactly who and where you are sending funds to, confidently.

### Is my domain secure?
Yes. Your Handshake name is completely unique and there can be no duplicates. When sending funds to an unknown or known crypto address that has HGA, a unique photo appears so you are confident you have the correct address. This is the same when you access a Handshake TLD.

### Can I sell my Handshake TLD domain?
Yes, absolutely! It’s your domain, you own it and can do whatever you’d like with it. Use any verified Handshake registrar to buy, sell and manage your Handshake TLD’s. In the near future, companies such as Urkel, will also give you the opportunity to sell sub domains from your TLD. If you have any questions, give us a shout and we’d be happy to help.

## The Handshake Alliance
### What is the Handshake Alliance?
We are a coalition of companies and developers building open source tools and infrastructure for the Handshake network. Our mission is to expedite the adoption of handshake and see its power in the hands of the ordinary consumer.

### What resources do they provide?
We provide a slew of applications catering to developers and consumers alike. Check them out <a href="/en/resources">here</a>.
